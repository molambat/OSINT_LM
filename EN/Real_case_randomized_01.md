## Detailed Findings:

### 1. Name & Identity
- Full name provided: **GXXXXXt X SXXls**  
- Confirmed in public records under this format.  
- Estimated age: 28 — consistent with client info and database entries.

### 2. Associated Address
- **Main address found**:  
  `XX Tecoma Cir, Littleton, CO 80127`  
  (Family-looking residential house, confirmed via Google Street View)

- Other residents at this address:  
  - **MXXXX X. SXXls** (likely father, 62)  
  - **KXXe X. SXXls** (likely brother, 23)

> No recent address changes were found despite his past claim of living in Colorado Springs.

### 3. Phone Numbers
- **(720) XXX-0X67** — often associated with this address but registered under a different name.
- **(720) XXX-8X83** — connected to *Numbers Accounting Service, LLC* operating at the same address (may belong to a relative).

Neither number is conclusively tied to the subject, but **both are tied to his immediate environment**.

### 4. Social Media & Online Presence
- **Facebook**: Active account [facebook.com/GXXXXXt.sXXls.2024](https://www.facebook.com/GXXXXXt.sXXls.2024) — profile is private, profile photo seems current.
- **Medium**: [medium.com/@GXXXXXt](https://medium.com/@GXXXXXt) — inactive.
- **Amazon**: Published a novel titled *HIDDEN* in 2024 under the name “GXXXXXt X SXXls” — consistent with Colorado residency.

No LinkedIn, Indeed, or other employment-related profiles found (nothing verifying Starbucks job).

## Final Hypothesis:

> There appears to be **only one Garrett L. SXXls** matching the full name, age range, and state.  
> He is **most likely still residing at the family home** in Littleton, Colorado.  
> While phone ownership remains uncertain, **both numbers trace back to this same household**.  
> He also has an active (albeit private) Facebook profile, which could serve as a contact point.

---

## Recommendations:

- [ ] Try to **reach out via Facebook Messenger or Instagram** (account confirmed active).
- [ ] Consider sending a **neutral letter to the Littleton address** (no threats, just factual).
- [ ] Search Colorado's public child support registry (if applicable).
- [ ] If necessary, consult an attorney to initiate a formal paternity process.
