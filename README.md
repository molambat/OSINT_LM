## What I Do

As an OSINT freelancer, I help individuals and organizations investigate:
 - Suspicious or anonymous profiles
 - Crypto frauds, marketplace scams, e-commerce theft
 - Romance scams, catfishing, crypto frauds
 - Online reputation issues and impersonations
 - China-based vendors and platform legitimacy
 - Identity leaks and unauthorized use of content (including NSFW)

All services are delivered remotely, ethically, and based only on open-source/public data. No interaction with targets, no hacking, no intrusion.

### Quick Profile Scan

A short investigation of a single identity or account (e.g. dating app, Telegram, Instagram). Includes footprint analysis, behavioral check, username trace, and a PDF summary.

### Full Digital Audit

Comprehensive scan of 1 to 3 linked profiles or identities across platforms. Detect fake activity, hidden connections, trace inconsistencies, and review digital hygiene.

### Advanced Profiling & Network Mapping

In-depth OSINT investigation with connection analysis, timeline reconstruction, cross-platform alias tracing, and a visual “Maltego-style” relationship graph.

### Monthly Monitoring

Passive watch on a person, alias or brand. Monthly report includes PimEyes monitoring, new leak alerts, domain mentions, username/email tracking, and threat intelligence.

### China & E-commerce Verification

Specialized research for B2B/B2C frauds linked to Asia (e.g. AliExpress, DHGate, WeChat vendors).
Includes domain tracing, Chinese business registry search (QCC, Tianyancha), seller verification, hosting & ICP data, product chain and scam signal analysis.

### Marketplace Scam Check

OSINT scan on a seller profile (Facebook Marketplace, Vinted, LeBonCoin, Etsy...).
Detect image reuse, feedback manipulation, suspicious patterns, and delivery risks.

### 🔞 Content Leak & Impersonation Check (NSFW-friendly)

Service for OnlyFans/NSFW creators: scan for reposts, fake accounts, stolen content, and leaks on indexing sites, forums, or dark web mirrors. Delivered as an anonymized PDF.

### Urgent Micro Check

A fast, express scan of one identity or case — ideal if you’re unsure about someone and want a quick, ethical read before acting.
